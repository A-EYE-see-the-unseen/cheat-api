// The error you're encountering is likely due to the dbconn object being undefined or not properly initialized. Here are a few things you can check to resolve the issue:

// Verify that the dbconn object is properly imported from the ./models module. Make sure the file exports the dbconn object correctly.

// Ensure that the database connection is established before executing the query. It seems that dbconn is an instance of a database connection, so make sure it is properly initialized with the required configuration.

// Here's an example of establishing a MySQL connection using the mysql2 library:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

// const dbconn = mysql.createConnection({
//   host: 'localhost',
//   user: 'your_username',
//   password: 'your_password',
//   database: 'your_database'
// });

// module.exports = {
//   dbconn
// };
// Double-check that your ./models module sets up the database connection correctly.

// Verify that the query syntax is correct. Ensure that the query string passed to the dbconn.query() method is properly formatted. In your case, it should be:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const rows = await dbconn.query('SELECT * FROM pengawas WHERE username = ? && password = ?', [username, password]);
// Note that the query placeholders (?) are followed by an array of parameter values in the correct order.

// By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'query')" error.
